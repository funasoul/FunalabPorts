description         Tool for generating Clang's JSON Compilation Database file for GNU make-based build systems.
long_description    It's aimed mainly at non-cmake (cmake already generates compilation database) large codebases. Inspired by projects like YCM-Generator and Bear, but faster (mainly with large projects), since in most cases it doesn't need a clean build (as the mentioned tools do) to generate the compilation database file, to achieve this it uses the make options such as -n/--dry-run and -k/--keep-going to extract the compile commands. Also, it's more cross-compiling friendly than YCM-generator's fake-toolchanin approach.
