description         A Python Mocking and Patching Library for Testing
long_description  \
    mock is a library for testing in Python. It allows you to replace \
    parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions \
    about how they have been used. \
    mock is now part of the Python standard library, available as \
    unittest.mock in Python 3.3 onwards. \
    This package contains a rolling backport of the standard library mock code \
    compatible with Python 2.6 and up, and 3.3 and up. \
    Please see the standard library documentation for more details.
