description         Lighter browser automation based on Selenium.
long_description    Helium is a Python library for automating web browsers. Under the hood, Helium forwards each call to Selenium. The difference is that Helium's API is much more high-level. In Selenium, you need to use HTML IDs, XPaths and CSS selectors to identify web page elements. Helium on the other hand lets you refer to elements by their user-visible labels. As a result, Helium scripts are 30-50% shorter than similar Selenium scripts. What's more, they are easier to read and more stable with respect to changes in the underlying web page.
